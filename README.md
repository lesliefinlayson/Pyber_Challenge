# Ride Share Data Analysis by City Type

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to identify potential ways to improve access to ride-share services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods by analyzing how ride-share data differs by city type.

## Results
The ride-share data comes from two files containing information about rides, drivers, fare amounts, dates and city type(rural, suburban, urban).  Combining and manipulating these fields provides further information about total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.  The results are:

_Total Rides by City Type_

Urban cities have the greatest number of rides.  Total number of rides for urban cities is approximately thirteen times greater than rural cities and over two times greater than suburban cities.

_Total Drivers by City Type_

Urban cities have the greatest number of drivers.  Total number of drivers for urban cities is ofver thirty times greater than rural cities and almost five times greater than suburban cities.

_Total Fares by City Type_

Urban cities have the highest total fares.  Total fares generated in urban cities is almost ten times greater than rural cities and over two times greater than suburban cities.

_Average Fare per Ride by City Type_

The average fare per ride is highest in rural cities.  Rural city average fare per ride is almost 12% greater than average fare per ride in suburban cities and 41% greater than the average fare per ride calculated for urban cities.

_Average Fare per Driver by City Type_

The average fare per driver is highest in rural cities.  Rural city average fare per drriver is calcuated to be over 40% greater than average fare per ride in suburban cities and over three times greater than the average fare per ride for urban cities.

_Total Fares Over Time by City Type_

Total fares were also analyzed by city type over time, from beginning of January through the end if April, resulting in the following graph:

Tracking fares over time also shows that urban cities generated much higher revenue in fares compared to urban and rural cities.  

## Summary

Analysis of the rider-share data by city type shows that urban cities have both the highest access and best affordability for ride-sharing.  In contrast, rural cities have the least access and the highest cost in average fares.  

To address this disparity, PyBer might consider:

Beginning with rural communities, because they are the most under-served and costly:
   •	 Bring in more drivers.  More drivers may make ride-sharing more available to more users.  
   •	 Placing a cap on how much a fare may cost.  This might make ride-sharing more affordable and therefore more attractive to potential users.
   •   Advertise these changes, provide incentives.  Find ways to let the public know that ride-sharing is a viable transportation option.  

If actions 1 and 2 are tried and have success in rural cities, bring to suburban cities.  

Further analysis may be needed to verify that these measures are cost-effective, especially if a cap is placed on fare costs.
